Limn is a Pen Plotter that can draw, write and color on any flat surface including paper, metal, glass, plastic, copper clad board, etc. This post talks about the progress made in the first Prototype of the Plotter.

Prototype Demo
==============

##Drive System

Limn follows a simple 2 + 2 axis model where the printing bed is Y axis, Print Head is X axis. The Z axis is used to position the print head accurately, while the P axis lowers the pen vertically.

The drive system currently uses the [RAMPS]('http://reprap.org/wiki/RAMPS_1.3') Arduino Mega Shield with an [A4983]('http://reprap.org/wiki/A4983#Stepper_driver_chips') stepper motor driver. The thermostats, heater and limit-switch debounce circuits have been removed from the board. Current Bill-of-Material (BOM) includes:

- Stepper Motors (Ones taken from old Printer or CNC works just fine) 5 (1x X-Axis, 1x Y-Axis, 2x Z-Axis, 1x Linear Actuator) [eBay.in](http://www.ebay.in/itm/like/181740428717?aff_source=Sok-Goog)
- A4983 Breakout Board (Stepper Motor Driver) 4 (X, Y, Z, P Axis) [sparkfun](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12859)
- Staedtler Lumocolor 318 Fine 0.6mm Line Permanent Pen [Amazon.in](http://www.amazon.in/Staedtler-Lumocolor-318-Permanent-Shades/dp/B000J6D9GW?tag=googinhydr18418-21&kpid=B000J6D9GW&tag=googinkenshoo-21&ascsubtag=191623e9-9936-2ca8-c271-000040db7a77)
- 12V, 5A SMPS [eBay.in](http://www.ebay.in/itm/like/271339787128?aff_source=Sok-Goog)

A few of the parts, that were 3D Printed, and may be found in the GitHub repository.

##What Happens When
The firmware of limn is a GCode parser and interpreter. Using GCode grammar, it moves the stepper motors of all the axes in just the precise amount for the pen to reach the given coordinates.  

A sample GCode: `G1 X53 Y53`. It instructs the print-head to reach the `(53, 53)` of the Bed.

Whatever the image that you need plotted, is converted into a set of GCode instructions. These instructions are fed into the Limn hardware, and pen moves according to the same instruction set plotting the image precisely.

##Plan of action
Limn is currently under pre-alpha testing where I'm only optimizing and implementing the firmware. Next, I'd be working to reduce the hardware and the number of stepper motors from 5 to 3 (or, 2). I also plan to convert this plotter into a low power Laser Cutter which would not require drastic changes.

The Firmware and Client Software is licensed under MIT and can be used freely with attributions. 

The Hardware is an Open Source Hardware.
