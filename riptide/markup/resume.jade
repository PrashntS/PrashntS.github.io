            p Developed and shipped a utility for digitizing waveforms and
              | extracting metadata from ECG reports, written in pure Python.
              | It is being used at Brigham and Womenâ€™s Hospital, Boston for
              | processing more than a million patient records.
            p Also worked on extracting normalized tabular data from scanned
              | medical records. Key challenges here involved handling skewed,
              | desaturated and otherwise low quality images.

            h4 Human Activity Recognition from Acceleration data Under
              | Naturalistic Conditions
            p The goal of this project was to develop a system for recognition
              | of low level human activities, such as Walking, Running,
              | Sitting, etc., using a single tri-axial accelerometer time
              | series. The undertaken challenge of this system was to
              | effectively solve the recognition task irrespective of the
              | location of sensor on human body.
            p Using supervised learning method, we trained a Random Forest
              | Classifier using feature vectors obtained via our model. We
              | were able to produce an accuracy of 95% through our model.
