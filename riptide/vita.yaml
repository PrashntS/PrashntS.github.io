      # Event aggregation and Recommendation

      In this ongoing project, I am responsible for designing and
      building a scalable server and `API` for aggregation,
      categorisation, and recommendation generation of events from
      various sources.

      # Computer Vision and Information Extraction

      Developed and shipped a utility for digitizing waveforms and
      extracting metadata from ECG reports, written in pure Python.
      It is being used at Brigham and Womenâ€™s Hospital, Boston for
      processing more than a million patient records.

      Also worked on extracting normalized tabular data from scanned
      medical records. Key challenges here involved handling skewed,
      desaturated and otherwise low quality images.

      # Human Activity Recognition from Acceleration data Under Naturalistic Conditions

      The goal of this project was to develop a system for recognition
      of low level human activities, such as Walking, Running,
      Sitting, etc., using a single tri-axial accelerometer time
      series. The undertaken challenge of this system was to
      effectively solve the recognition task irrespective of the
      location of sensor on human body.

      Using supervised learning method, we trained a Random Forest
      Classifier using feature vectors obtained via our model. We
      were able to produce an accuracy of `95%` through our model.

      # Aspiring Researcher Challenge

      As a research associate, I was part of the team which was
      responsible for developing a large, online experiment to study
      the wisdom of the crowd where I formulated the algorithm for
      scraping and formatting raw data off multiple crowdfunding
      platforms.

      # Modelling and Network Analysis of Intronic miRNA Mediated Gene Expression Regulation

      In this project, we developed a mathematical model for gene expression
      regulation via intronic micro RNAs, based on emperical data and
      experimental observations at IGIB.

      As a part of study, we've also generated a miRNA - mRNA target network
      using various available databases.
